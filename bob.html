<h1>Bob</h1>
<p>Bob is our best and favourite programmer, he is reliable, responsible, and has amazingly good chat. If I could have Bob as my brother I would, he'd never let me down and is also really REALLY hot, he has to fight off the pussay wherever he goes.</p>
<h2>More reasons</h2>
<p>His name isn't Iona really...and as she's the only other hardcore progger we have, I have no idea how we've got so far.</p>
